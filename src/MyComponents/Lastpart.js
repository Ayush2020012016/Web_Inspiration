          <div className="heading">WHAT ARE THE MAIN FEATURES OF WEB DESIGN INSPIRATION?</div>
          <div className="paradiv">Finding inspiration for your next website design isn’t just about saving time and money on your next design and development project. Of course, you do enjoy those benefits, but you can also take advantage of a wealth of additional features and opportunities to ensure you get the exact style of website to meet your needs.</div>
          <div className="heading">Benchmarking</div>
          <div className="paradiv">We know that when browsing through our website, you’re not simply going to find one design and decide that’s the one for you. It wouldn’t be smart to take that approach, either. Instead, you’re more likely to spend time gathering your favourite web designs before deciding on the one you want to use.</div>
          <div className="paradiv">But, with so many designs to potentially choose from, how do you know which one is best?</div>
          <div className="paradiv">This is where benchmarking comes in, allowing you to compare your chosen designs against each other, not to mention against your current website, if you have one, and your competitors’ websites that you want to make sure your site is better than. Whether you want to compare the design styles used, the use of color, or get an idea of the effectiveness of the available calls to action, we’ll put you on track to decide with confidence on the right design to meet your needs.</div>
